<h1 id="post-mortem-report-for-tame-project">Post-mortem Report for TAME project</h1>
<h2 id="what-where-the-challenges">What where the challenges?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I was inexperienced in:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Neural networks</li>
<li>Pycharm</li>
<li>Pytorch</li>
<li>Researching an academic topic through papers</li>
<li>Working</li>
<li>Juggling work and university</li>
<li>Using linux tools (bash, command line tools etc.)</li>
<li>Writing an academic paper to be published</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I procrastinated a lot of my time being non-productive.</li>
<li>I had no timetable to adhere to.</li>
<li>I did not know if I would be offered a chance to continue working.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-went-well">What went well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I was able to learn a lot of things, such as:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Neural networks</li>
<li>Pytorch</li>
<li>Reading and understanding papers</li>
<li>Stress management</li>
<li>Writing academic papers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I took a chill approach to challenges by methodically learning new skills, studying the docs and trying things out. I think this should be something to always do when time isnâ€™t extremely constrained</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="were-there-issues-with-the-quality-or-compromises-along-the-way">Were there issues with the quality or compromises along the way?</h2>
<p>Yes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not try all the possibilities I wanted to. The training took way too long so a lot of things dragged out much more than anticipated.</li>
<li>I started writing the paper just 1.5 weeks before the deadline for submissions, so the whole process felt rushed and grueling. I was not totally satisfied with my work and felt like I should have started writing the paper much sooner, as to be able to supplement it with extra experimental data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-would-you-change-or-improve-for-future-projects">What would you change or improve for future projects?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I would be much more careful with my time management, by making an anticipated and periodically updating it to understand which parts are taking too long and should be hurried.</li>
<li>I would do a more general overview of the research area and outline several possibilities at the start of the project, instead of constantly trying out possibilies (which is not bad but should not be overdone imo).</li>
